About

Salam/ Hello! I'm Huda, a passionate web developer specializing in frontend development. I love creating remarkable experiences on the web and bringing ideas to life.

My journey as a tech enthusiast started during my school days, where I delved into the world of programming by learning C++. Since then, my passion for technology has only grown stronger. 
At present, my main focus lies in building accessible, inclusive products, elegant, responsive, and user-friendly web applications for a diverse range of clients. 

I have been working extensively with JavaScript, React JS, Node JS, and Webflow. I find immense joy in crafting innovative solutions and continuously expanding my skill set.
